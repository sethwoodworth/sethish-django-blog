You remember that thing that every [hacker](http://www.betabeat.com/2011/07/05/the-mainstream-media-doesnt-understand-the-word-hacker-2011-07-05/ "loaded term") says that they will never do, but eventually does?  No, not getting a Mac, building their own blog.

As you may already know, I run Linux. (Come to think of it, I run Linux on my laptop, desktop, phone, tablet and stereo/TV.) I used to be more of a zealot about this fact than I am currently, and I would like to think that I am examining my beliefs and the beliefs of those around me in a slightly more critical light due to my reading of the [Less]() [Wrong]() [sequences]().  But let me back up a step and explain where I am coming from on this.

[Ivan KrstiÄ‡]() is an infamous [Linux apostate](http://radian.org/notebook/2009-05-11 "Another loaded term") who architeched [One Laptop per Child's](http://laptop.org/ "OLPC") security system [Bitfrost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfrost "Wikipedia") left around the time of the Windows/OLPC debacle and eventually went to work for [a fruit vendor](http://apple.com) in California.

    "...I got so furious that I went to the nearest Apple store and bought a MacBook. After 12 years of almost exclusive use of free software, I switched to Mac OS X. And you know, shitty power management and many other hassles aren't Linux's fault. The fault lies with needlessly secretive vendors not releasing documentation that would make it possible for Linux to play well with their hardware. But until the day comes when hardware vendors and free software developers find themselves holding hands and spontaneously bursting into one giant orgiastic Kumbaya, that's the world we live in. So in the meantime, I switched to OS X and find it to be an overwhelmingly more enjoyable computing experience. I still have my free software UNIX shell, my free software programming language, my free software ports system, my free software editor, and I run a bunch of free software Linux virtual machines. The vast, near-total majority of computer users aren't programmers. Of the programmers, a vast, near-total majority don't dare in the Land o' Kernel tread. As one of the people who actually can hack my kernel to suit, I find that I don't miss the ability in the least. There, I said it. Hang me for treason."

I admit, I have problems with Ubuntu (my linux of choice).  My laptop's graphics chipset does not want to play nicely with the latest X.org version, nor want to provide on-the-fly graphics switching like the cool kids get in Microsoft and Apple land.  I always have the idea in the back of my mind, that I could take anything I am currently using on my laptop, and turn it into a free software kiosk, package a collection of software and deploy it on a tablet or laptop for use in education, or deploy it to a production server.  If I only took a little extra time, I could make my own tiling window manager, but with just the bare minimum features that I want and can hybernate between keystrokes.  Or, I could, ya know, do something as crazy as building my own blog engine.

    "Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad." - Neal Stephenson ([Snow Crash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash))
